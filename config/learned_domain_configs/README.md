# Learned Domain Configurations

This directory contains domain-specific configurations **learned by the Domain Intelligence Agent** from analyzing document content and extracting statistical patterns.

## What's Generated Here

- `{domain}_config.yaml` - Domain-specific extraction configurations learned from document analysis
- Configuration parameters optimized based on content characteristics
- Statistical thresholds adapted to domain-specific patterns
- Entity extraction rules discovered from domain content

## How Configurations Are Learned

1. **Content Analysis**: Domain Intelligence Agent analyzes document corpus
2. **Pattern Extraction**: Statistical analysis identifies domain-specific patterns  
3. **Parameter Optimization**: ML algorithms optimize extraction thresholds
4. **Configuration Generation**: Learned parameters saved as YAML configs

## Usage

These learned configurations enable:
- **Zero-Config Domain Adaptation**: Automatic optimization for new domains
- **Knowledge Extraction Tuning**: Domain-specific entity/relationship extraction
- **Performance Optimization**: Learned parameters improve extraction accuracy
- **Runtime Adaptation**: Dynamic configuration based on content analysis

## Key Features

- **Data-Driven**: No hardcoded assumptions, purely learned from content
- **Domain-Adaptive**: Each domain gets optimized extraction parameters
- **Continuously Learning**: Configurations improve with more data
- **Production-Ready**: Used by knowledge extraction agents in real-time
