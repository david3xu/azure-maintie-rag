## Context: Universal Knowledge Extraction

**Your Role**: You're helping build an intelligent knowledge system for {{ discovered_domain_description }} that will help professionals quickly find solutions and insights.

**Domain Intelligence**: Based on content analysis, this domain typically contains:
{% for pattern in discovered_content_patterns %}
- **{{ pattern.category }}**: {{ pattern.description }} ({{ pattern.examples|join(', ') }})
{% endfor %}

**Quality Standards**: Extract entities that would help a professional understand:
{% for insight in key_domain_insights %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ insight }}
{% endfor %}

## Content to Analyze:

{% for text in texts %}
**Document {{ loop.index }}**: {{ text }}
{% endfor %}

## Required Output Format:

For each document, extract all meaningful entities with their context. Return a JSON array where each object represents an entity found in the text:

```json
[
  {
    "entity_id": "entity_1",
    "text": "{{ example_entity }}",
    "entity_type": "{{ adaptive_entity_type }}",
    "confidence": {{ entity_confidence_threshold }},
    "context": "surrounding text context",
    "source_document": 1,
    "semantic_role": "discovered_role",
    "domain_relevance": "how this entity matters in {{ domain_signature }}"
  }
]
```

**Guidelines for Quality Extraction**:
- Extract entities exactly as they appear in the content
- Assign confidence scores based on clarity (threshold: {{ entity_confidence_threshold }})
- Provide meaningful context from the source
- Use entity types discovered from domain analysis
- Focus on entities relevant to {{ discovered_domain_description }}
- Include both concrete objects and abstract concepts

**Entity Type Guidelines**:
- Use types discovered from content analysis: {{ discovered_entity_types|join(', ') }}
- Create types that reflect categories professionals would recognize
- Be consistent with similar entities across the domain
- Adapt to the vocabulary and terminology found in the actual content

Extract all meaningful entities from each document. Quality and domain relevance are prioritized over quantity.
