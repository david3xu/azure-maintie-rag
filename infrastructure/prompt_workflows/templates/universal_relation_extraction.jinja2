## Context: Universal Relationship Discovery

{% if discovered_domain_description %}
**Your Role**: You're analyzing content from {{ discovered_domain_description }} to understand how different entities relate to each other, building a knowledge graph that professionals can use for reasoning and problem-solving.

**Discovered Relationship Patterns**: Based on domain analysis, this content typically contains:
{% else %}
**Your Role**: Analyze the provided content to identify meaningful relationships between entities, building a knowledge graph for information retrieval and reasoning.

**Relationship Discovery**: Extract relationships that represent:
{% endif %}

{% if discovered_relationship_patterns %}
{% for pattern in discovered_relationship_patterns %}
**{{ pattern.category }} Relationships**:
{% for rel_type in pattern.relationship_types %}
- `{{ rel_type.name }}`: {{ rel_type.description }} (Example: {{ rel_type.example }})
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
**Common Relationship Types**:
- `contains`, `part_of`: Compositional relationships
- `causes`, `leads_to`: Causal relationships  
- `depends_on`, `requires`: Dependency relationships
- `located_at`, `positioned_in`: Spatial relationships
- `implements`, `uses`: Functional relationships
- `associated_with`, `related_to`: General associations
{% endif %}

## Entities Found in Content:
{% if entities %}
**Available Entities**: {{ entities|join(', ') }}
{% endif %}

## Content Context:
{% for text in texts %}
**Document {{ loop.index }}**: {{ text }}
{% endfor %}

## Required Output Format:

Extract all meaningful relationships between entities found in this content. Return a JSON array where each object represents a relationship:

```json
[
  {
    "relation_id": "rel_1",
    "source_entity": "discovered_source_entity",
    "target_entity": "discovered_target_entity", 
    "relation_type": "relates_to",
    "confidence": {{ relationship_confidence_threshold }},
    "context": "source text containing relationship",
    "source_document": 1,
    "direction": "directed",
    "domain_relevance": "how this relationship matters in {{ discovered_domain_description }}"
  }
]
```

**Relationship Extraction Guidelines**:
- Focus on relationships that would help professionals understand:
{% for insight in relationship_insights %}
  {{ loop.index }}. {{ insight }}
{% endfor %}

- Extract relationships as naturally expressed in the domain language
- Use relationship types discovered from content analysis
- Include both explicit (directly stated) and implicit (clearly implied) relationships
- Assign confidence based on clarity (threshold: {{ relationship_confidence_threshold }})
- Provide specific context where the relationship appears

**Quality Focus**:
- Prioritize relationships that enable domain-specific reasoning
- Include hierarchical relationships discovered in content structure
- Capture causal relationships that help predict patterns
- Extract functional relationships that link concepts to applications

**Adaptive Relationship Types**:
Based on domain analysis, focus on these discovered relationship categories:
{{ discovered_relationship_types|join(', ') }}

Extract all meaningful relationships you can identify. Comprehensive coverage helps build a more useful knowledge graph for {{ discovered_domain_description }} decision-making.
