## Context: Universal Knowledge Extraction


**Your Role**: You're helping build an intelligent knowledge system for universal content without domain-specific analysis that will help professionals quickly find solutions and insights.

**Domain Intelligence**: Based on content analysis, this domain typically contains:

- **General**: Universal content pattern (concept, entity, term)


**Quality Standards**: Extract entities that would help a professional understand:

1. Universal content analysis without domain assumptions

2. Domain-agnostic entity and relationship extraction

3. Fallback approach for any content type

4. Adaptive to discovered content characteristics

5. No predetermined domain categories



## Content to Analyze:



## Required Output Format:

For each document, extract all meaningful entities with their context. Return a JSON array where each object represents an entity found in the text:

```json
[
  {
    "entity_id": "entity_1",
    "text": "example_concept",
    "entity_type": "concept",
    "confidence": 0.7,
    "context": "surrounding text context",
    "source_document": 1,
    "semantic_role": "discovered_role",
    "domain_relevance": "how this entity matters in universal_fallback"
  }
]
```

**Guidelines for Quality Extraction**:
- Extract entities exactly as they appear in the content
- Assign confidence scores based on clarity (threshold: 0.7)
- Provide meaningful context from the source

- Use entity types discovered from domain analysis
- Focus on entities relevant to universal content without domain-specific analysis

- Include both concrete objects and abstract concepts

**Entity Type Guidelines**:

- Use types discovered from content analysis: concept, entity, term, proper_noun
- Create types that reflect categories professionals would recognize

- Be consistent with similar entities across the domain
- Adapt to the vocabulary and terminology found in the actual content

Extract all meaningful entities from each document. Quality and domain relevance are prioritized over quantity.
