## Context: Universal Relationship Discovery


**Your Role**: You're analyzing content from universal content without domain-specific analysis to understand how different entities relate to each other, building a knowledge graph that professionals can use for reasoning and problem-solving.

**Discovered Relationship Patterns**: Based on domain analysis, this content typically contains:




**Universal Relationships**:

- `relates_to`: General relationship (Example: A relates to B)

- `contains`: Containment relationship (Example: A contains B)

- `associated_with`: Association relationship (Example: A associated with B)




## Entities Found in Content:


## Content Context:


## Required Output Format:

Extract all meaningful relationships between entities found in this content. Return a JSON array where each object represents a relationship:

```json
[
  {
    "relation_id": "rel_1",
    "source_entity": "discovered_source_entity",
    "target_entity": "discovered_target_entity", 
    "relation_type": "relates_to",
    "confidence": 0.6,
    "context": "source text containing relationship",
    "source_document": 1,
    "direction": "directed",
    "domain_relevance": "how this relationship matters in universal content without domain-specific analysis"
  }
]
```

**Relationship Extraction Guidelines**:
- Focus on relationships that would help professionals understand:

  1. How entities relate in general content

  2. Universal relationship patterns

  3. Content-agnostic associations


- Extract relationships as naturally expressed in the domain language
- Use relationship types discovered from content analysis
- Include both explicit (directly stated) and implicit (clearly implied) relationships
- Assign confidence based on clarity (threshold: 0.6)
- Provide specific context where the relationship appears

**Quality Focus**:
- Prioritize relationships that enable domain-specific reasoning
- Include hierarchical relationships discovered in content structure
- Capture causal relationships that help predict patterns
- Extract functional relationships that link concepts to applications

**Adaptive Relationship Types**:
Based on domain analysis, focus on these discovered relationship categories:
relates_to, contains, associated_with

Extract all meaningful relationships you can identify. Comprehensive coverage helps build a more useful knowledge graph for universal content without domain-specific analysis decision-making.
