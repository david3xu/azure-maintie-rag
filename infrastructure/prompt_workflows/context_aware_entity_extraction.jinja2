## Context: Maintenance Knowledge Extraction

**Your Role**: You're helping build an intelligent maintenance knowledge system that will help technicians quickly find solutions to equipment problems.

**Domain Knowledge**: You understand that maintenance records contain:
- **Equipment**: Primary systems (air conditioner, compressor, engine, pump)
- **Components**: Parts within equipment (thermostat, valve, hose, bearing, filter)
- **Problems**: Issues that occur (not working, unserviceable, blown, cracked, leaking)
- **Locations**: Where issues occur (left hand, near side, position, on, off)
- **Actions**: What needs to be done (replace, repair, check, service, analyse)
- **Conditions**: States and measurements (pressure, temperature, worn, seized)

**Quality Standards**: Extract entities that would help a maintenance technician understand:
1. What equipment is involved?
2. What specific components are affected?
3. What problems are occurring?
4. Where the problems are located?
5. What actions are needed?

## Maintenance Records to Analyze:

{% for text in texts %}
**Record {{ loop.index }}**: {{ text }}
{% endfor %}

## Required Output Format:

For each maintenance record, extract all meaningful entities with their context. Return a JSON array where each object represents an entity found in the text:

```json
[
  {
    "entity_id": "entity_1",
    "text": "air conditioner",
    "entity_type": "equipment",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "context": "air conditioner thermostat not working",
    "source_record": 1,
    "semantic_role": "primary_system",
    "maintenance_relevance": "equipment requiring service"
  },
  {
    "entity_id": "entity_2",
    "text": "thermostat",
    "entity_type": "component",
    "confidence": 0.90,
    "context": "air conditioner thermostat not working",
    "source_record": 1,
    "semantic_role": "component",
    "maintenance_relevance": "component with problem"
  }
]
```

**Guidelines for Quality Extraction**:
- Extract entities exactly as they appear in the maintenance records
- Assign confidence scores based on how clearly the entity is mentioned
- Provide the full context where the entity appears
- Choose entity types that make sense for maintenance work
- Focus on entities that would be useful for finding similar problems or solutions
- Include both concrete objects (equipment, parts) and abstract concepts (problems, conditions)

**Entity Type Guidelines**:
- Use specific, descriptive types (e.g., "cooling_equipment" instead of just "equipment")
- Create types that reflect maintenance categories technicians would recognize
- Be consistent within similar entities (all air conditioning components should have similar type patterns)

Extract all meaningful entities from each record - don't limit yourself to a fixed number. Quality and completeness are more important than brevity.
