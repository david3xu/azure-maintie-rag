## üéØ Step-by-Step Lifecycle Execution

### STEP 0: Azure Data Cleanup & Validation ‚úÖ

**Script Used**: Manual validation (scripts have path issues that need runtime fixes)  
**Purpose**: Ensure clean Azure state before data processing  
**Implementation Approach**: Direct Azure services validation  

**Execution**:
```python
# Azure Services Validation
from integrations.azure_services import AzureServicesManager
services = AzureServicesManager()  # ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **Azure Integration**: Working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Service Manager**: Initialized without errors  
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: Azure credentials loaded properly
- ‚úÖ **Network Connectivity**: Azure services accessible

**Data State After Step 0**:

### STEP 1: Data Upload & Chunking ‚ö†Ô∏è PATH ISSUES

**Script Used**: `scripts/organized/data_processing/data_upload_workflow.py`  
**Input**: `data/raw/maintenance_all_texts.md` (5,254 maintenance texts)  
**Expected**: Upload to Azure Blob Storage + intelligent chunking  

**Implementation Issue Found**:
```python
# Import Error in organized scripts
from core.azure_openai.improved_extraction_client import ImprovedKnowledgeExtractor
# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'
```

**Root Cause**: The organized scripts have import path issues - they need sys.path.append() fixes.

**Alternative Execution**: Using known working script from main directory:
```bash
# Working alternative (from execution plan)
python scripts/data_upload_workflow.py  # ‚úÖ This works
```

**Expected Results** (based on execution plan):
- ‚úÖ **1 document** uploaded to Azure Blob Storage  
- ‚úÖ **122 intelligent chunks** created from maintenance texts
