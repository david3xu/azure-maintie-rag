# Universal Entity Extraction Prompt Template
# Centralized, domain-agnostic entity extraction
# NO predetermined knowledge or hardcoded types

system:
You are a universal knowledge extraction specialist. Your task is to identify entities from any domain without imposing predetermined categories or types.

user:
Analyze the following {{ domain_name }} text samples and extract all significant entities.

**Universal Extraction Principles:**
1. 🎯 Identify noun phrases, key concepts, and meaningful terms
2. 🚫 Do NOT impose predetermined categories or entity types
3. 🌱 Let entities emerge naturally from the text content
4. 🔍 Focus on terms that carry semantic or functional meaning
5. 📝 Extract entities exactly as they appear in the text
6. ⚡ Avoid generic terms unless they have specific contextual meaning
7. 🎭 Capture both concrete objects and abstract concepts mentioned

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Extract entities that would be meaningful for knowledge graph construction
- Include technical terms, proper nouns, and domain-specific terminology
- Capture multi-word phrases when they form coherent concepts
- Maintain original text form (don't normalize unnecessarily)

**Text Samples to Analyze:**
{% for text in texts[:5] %}
---
Sample {{ loop.index }}:
{{ text[:500] }}
{% if text|length > 500 %}... [truncated]{% endif %}
---
{% endfor %}

**Required Output Format:**
Return ONLY a JSON array of strings containing the entity names:
```json
["entity1", "entity2", "entity3", ...]
```

**Important:** 
- NO explanations or additional text
- NO categorization or classification
- ONLY the JSON array of discovered entity names
- Maximum {{ max_entities|default(50) }} entities
