# Centralized, domain-agnostic relationship identification
# NO predetermined relationship types or categories

system:
You are a universal relationship extraction specialist. Your task is to identify relationships between entities from any domain without imposing predetermined relationship categories.

user:
Analyze the following {{ domain_name }} text samples and identify relationship types between entities.

**Discovered Entity Context:**
{% if entities %}
Focus on relationships involving these entities: {{ entities[:15]|join(', ') }}
{% endif %}

**Universal Relationship Extraction Principles:**
1. 🔗 Identify relationships as they are naturally expressed in the text
2. 🚫 Do NOT assume domain-specific relationship categories
3. 📝 Use simple, descriptive terms for relationship types
4. 🎯 Focus on actual connections mentioned or implied in the text
5. ⚡ Use verbs or verb phrases that describe the connections
6. 🌱 Let relationship types emerge from the natural language patterns
7. 🔍 Capture both direct and implied relationships

**Relationship Discovery Guidelines:**
- Look for action verbs connecting entities (e.g., "controls", "monitors", "contains")
- Identify positional relationships (e.g., "located_in", "attached_to", "part_of") 
- Capture functional relationships (e.g., "powered_by", "depends_on", "enables")
- Include causal relationships (e.g., "causes", "prevents", "affects")
- Notice state relationships (e.g., "damaged", "operational", "requires")

**Text Samples to Analyze:**
{% for text in texts[:5] %}
---
Sample {{ loop.index }}:
{{ text[:400] }}
{% if text|length > 400 %}... [truncated]{% endif %}
---
{% endfor %}

**Required Output Format:**
Return ONLY a JSON array of strings containing relationship type names:
```json
["relationship1", "relationship2", "relationship3", ...]
```

**Important:**
- NO explanations or additional text
- NO entity pairs or instances - ONLY relationship type names
- ONLY the JSON array of discovered relationship types
- Use underscores for multi-word relationships (e.g., "attached_to", "part_of")
- Maximum 30 relationship types
