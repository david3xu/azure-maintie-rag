# Knowledge Extraction Issues - Critical Diagnosis

**Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Status:** üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED  

## ‚ùå Current Problems

### **1. Broken Relationship Structures**
```json
// ALL relationships are broken - no entity linking!
{
  "relation_id": "relation_0",
  "source_entity_id": "",  // ‚ùå EMPTY
  "target_entity_id": "",  // ‚ùå EMPTY  
  "relation_type": "monitors",
  "confidence": 0.8
}
```

### **2. Massive Context Loss**
**Raw Rich Data:**
```
air conditioner thermostat not working
air receiver safety valves to be replaced
analyse failed driveline component  
auxiliary Cat engine lube service
axle temperature sensor fault
```

**Current Extraction Results:**
```json
{"text": "valve", "context": ""},
{"text": "sensor", "context": ""},
{"text": "engine", "context": ""}
```

**Information Loss: ~90% of semantic meaning is lost!**

### **3. Malformed JSON Output**
```json
"text": "air_conditioner\",",  // ‚ùå Invalid JSON
"text": "sheave\",",
"text": "battery\","
```

### **4. Disconnected Knowledge Graph**
```json
"graph_edges": 0  // ‚ùå No connections between entities!
```

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### **Prompt Engineering Issues**

**Current Entity Discovery Prompt:**
```
1. Return 8-12 most important entity types  // ‚ùå Too restrictive
2. Use lowercase with underscores           // ‚ùå Loses specificity
3. Focus on concrete, identifiable objects // ‚ùå Too generic
```

**Current Triplet Extraction:**
```
Entity types: valve, sensor, engine...      // ‚ùå Generic types only
Return up to 10 triplets                   // ‚ùå Quantity over quality
```

### **Processing Pipeline Issues**

1. **Over-Sampling**: Uses only 100 texts for discovery from 5000+ available
2. **Context Truncation**: Limits text to 1500-2000 chars, losing details
3. **Generic Type Focus**: Extracts broad categories instead of specific instances
4. **No Entity Resolution**: Doesn't link extracted entities to relations

## üéØ What Should Be Extracted

**From:** `"air conditioner thermostat not working"`

**Should Extract:**
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "text": "air conditioner thermostat",
      "entity_type": "hvac_component", 
      "context": "air conditioner thermostat not working",
      "specific_instance": "thermostat",
      "system": "air conditioner"
    }
  ],
  "relations": [
    {
      "source": "air conditioner thermostat",
      "target": "malfunction_state", 
      "relation_type": "has_status",
      "context": "not working"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Currently Extracting:**
```json
{
  "entities": [{"text": "valve", "context": ""}],
  "relations": [{"source_entity_id": "", "target_entity_id": ""}]
}
```

## üö® Impact Assessment

### **Universal RAG Performance**
- **Knowledge Coverage**: ~10% of available information captured
- **Relationship Accuracy**: 0% (all relations broken)  
- **Context Preservation**: ~5% (no meaningful context)
- **Query Relevance**: Severely compromised

### **Comparison Reality Check**
The optimistic performance predictions in our comparison document are **completely invalid** based on current extraction quality:

**Predicted vs Reality:**
- Domain Coverage: Predicted 85-95%, Reality ~10%
- Relationship Accuracy: Predicted 75-85%, Reality 0%
- Response Quality: Predicted expert-level, Reality broken

## üîß Required Fixes

### **Immediate (Critical)**
1. **Fix Entity-Relation Linking**: Ensure relations connect actual entities
2. **Preserve Rich Context**: Extract full phrases, not single words
3. **Fix JSON Formatting**: Clean up malformed extraction outputs
4. **Increase Context Limits**: Use full available text content

### **Prompt Engineering Overhaul**
1. **Entity Extraction**: Extract specific instances with full context
2. **Relationship Extraction**: Link specific entities, not generic types
3. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on accurate extraction, not limits

### **Pipeline Architecture**
1. **Process Full Dataset**: Don't oversample to 100 texts from 5000+
2. **Maintain Context**: Preserve original text context in extractions  
3. **Entity Resolution**: Link extracted entities to their relations
4. **Validation**: Add extraction quality validation

## üìä Extraction Quality Metrics

**Current State:**
- Entity Context Preservation: 5%
- Relationship Connectivity: 0%
- Information Completeness: 10%
- Semantic Accuracy: 15%

**Target State:**
- Entity Context Preservation: 85%+
- Relationship Connectivity: 90%+ 
- Information Completeness: 80%+
- Semantic Accuracy: 85%+

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Updated Performance Expectations

**Realistic Universal RAG Performance (Current System):**
- **Domain Coverage**: 10-15% (vs predicted 85-95%)
- **Relationship Accuracy**: 0-5% (vs predicted 75-85%)  
- **Query Relevance**: 20-30% (vs predicted 85-95%)
- **Response Quality**: Poor (vs predicted expert-level)

**With Fixes Applied:**
- **Domain Coverage**: 70-85%
- **Relationship Accuracy**: 60-75%
- **Query Relevance**: 75-85% 
- **Response Quality**: Good to very good

## üéØ Action Plan

### **Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)**
1. Fix entity-relation linking in extraction pipeline
2. Overhaul extraction prompts for rich context
3. Fix JSON formatting issues
4. Increase processing capacity

### **Phase 2: Quality Enhancement**  
1. Implement proper entity resolution
2. Add extraction validation
3. Enhance context preservation
4. Optimize for semantic accuracy

### **Phase 3: Performance Validation**
1. Test extraction quality on sample data
2. Validate relationship connectivity  
3. Measure information completeness
4. Update performance predictions

## üìù Conclusion

The current knowledge extraction system has **critical structural issues** that make it unsuitable for production use. The optimistic performance comparisons were based on theoretical capabilities, not actual implementation results.

**Immediate action required** to fix these fundamental problems before any meaningful performance evaluation can be conducted.
