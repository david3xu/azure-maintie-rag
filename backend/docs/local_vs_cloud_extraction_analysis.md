### **🔄 Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**

**Strategy:**
1. **Primary**: Cloud extraction for high-value/complex documents
2. **Secondary**: Local extraction for routine/repetitive content
3. **Fallback**: Local when cloud is unavailable
4. **Privacy**: Local for highly sensitive data

**Implementation:**
```python
class HybridKnowledgeExtractor:
    def extract(self, text, sensitivity_level="normal"):
        if sensitivity_level == "highly_sensitive":
            return self.local_extractor.extract(text)
        elif self.cloud_available and self.within_budget():
            return self.cloud_extractor.extract(text)  # 94.1% quality
        else:
            return self.local_extractor.extract(text)   # 75-85% quality
```
