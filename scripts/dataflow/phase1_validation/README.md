# Phase 1: Basic Agent Connectivity (Post-Cleanup)

**Purpose**: Validate basic agent connectivity and imports ONLY (databases are empty after Phase 0 cleanup)

## Scripts in This Phase:

- 01_00_basic_agent_connectivity.py - Basic connectivity validation (imports + initialization)

## Context:

- **Runs AFTER**: Phase 0 cleanup (databases are EMPTY)
- **Tests**: Imports, initialization, basic connectivity only
- **Cannot Test**: Full data processing capabilities (no data exists yet)
- **Next Step**: Phase 2 ingests data, then validates full agent processing

## Prerequisites:

- Phase 0 cleanup must be completed successfully
- Azure services must be operational and clean
- All agents must be importable

## Note:

**Full agent functionality validation happens in Phase 2 Step 5 after data ingestion.**
