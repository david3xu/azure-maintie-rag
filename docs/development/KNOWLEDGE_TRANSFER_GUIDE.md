```python
# Example: Adding a new search modality
class NewModalitySearchEngine:
    async def search(self, query: str, domain: str) -> SearchResult:
        # Implement with timeout enforcement
        return await timeout_enforcer.enforce_timeout(
            'new_modality_search',
            self._execute_search(query, domain),
            timeout=1.0
        )

# Register in ConsolidatedToolManager
def _register_core_tools(self):
    self.register_tool("new_modality_search", NewModalitySearchEngine().search)
```

#### **2. Extending Domain Intelligence**
```python

        patterns = self.pattern_engine.extract_patterns(content)
        return self._analyze_industry_specific(patterns, industry)
```

#### **3. Performance Monitoring Integration**
```python
# Example: Adding performance tracking to new operations
async def new_business_operation(self, request):
    start_time = time.time()

    try:
        result = await self._execute_operation(request)

        # Track performance
        metrics = QueryPerformanceMetrics(
            query=request.query,
            domain=request.domain,
            operation="new_business_operation",
            total_time=time.time() - start_time,
            cache_hit=False,
            search_times={},
            result_count=len(result),

        self._execute_with_retry(
            lambda: self.vector_engine.search(query, domain),
            max_retries=2
        ),
        self._execute_with_retry(
            lambda: self.graph_engine.search(query, domain),
            max_retries=2
        ),
        self._execute_with_retry(
            lambda: self.gnn_engine.search(query, domain),
            max_retries=2
        )
    ]

    # Execute in parallel with exception handling
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

```python
# Data-driven intelligence implementation
async def analyze_query_tools(self, query: str) -> List[str]:
    """ML-based tool recommendation (eliminates hardcoded heuristics)"""

    # Use domain detection instead of keyword matching
    detection_result = await detect_domain_from_query(ctx, query)

    # ML-based pattern analysis
    recommended_tools = []
    for pattern in detection_result.matched_patterns:
        if self._pattern_indicates_search(pattern):  # ML-based decision
            recommended_tools.append('tri_modal_search')
        elif self._pattern_indicates_analysis(pattern):  # ML-based decision
            recommended_tools.append('analyze_content')

    return recommended_tools
```
