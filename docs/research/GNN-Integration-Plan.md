# GNN-Enhanced RAG Integration Plan

## Project Vision

**Goal:**
Leverage MaintIE’s structured data to build a GNN-enhanced RAG pipeline, improving over traditional RAG and previous models (SPERT, REBEL) by:
- Using GNNs for domain query understanding and semantic expansion
- Enabling more domain-aware, structured retrieval and response

### Pipeline Comparison

|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| User Query                              | User Query                                                |
| → Query Rewriting                       | → Domain Query Understanding (GNN)                        |
| → Document Retrieval                    | → Semantic Query Expansion                                |
| → Context Assembly                      | → Structured Retrieval                                    |
| → LLM Response                          | → Context Assembly → Domain-Aware Response                |

## What’s Missing (for GNN-Enhanced RAG)

- **GNN-Based Query Understanding:**
  - No GNN model is currently integrated for domain query understanding.
  - Query expansion is not yet GNN-driven.
- **GNN Training/Inference Pipeline:**
  - No code for training or running a GNN on MaintIE’s graph data.
  - No GNN-based embeddings or node classification for query rewriting.
- **GNN-Driven Query Expansion:**
  - Query expansion is still rule-based or LLM-based, not leveraging GNN-inferred relationships.
- **Minimal Integration Points:**
  - The pipeline is ready for a GNN module, but the actual GNN “plug-in” is not present.

### Current Codebase Analysis – Integration Opportunities

**Real Component Relationships:**
```
1. query_structured.py (API Endpoint)
   ↓ calls
2. rag_system.process_query_structured() (Orchestrator)
   ↓ delegates to
3. structured_rag.process_query_optimized() (Pipeline)
   ↓ executes
4. _structured_retrieval() (Core Optimization)
   ↓ uses
5. vector_search.search() (1 API Call + Graph Operations)
```

**Specific Integration Points for GNN:**
- `_select_relevant_concepts()` – Currently stubbed with "TODO: Replace with actual knowledge graph operations"
- `_apply_knowledge_graph_ranking()` – Currently uses simple term matching instead of graph intelligence
- `_build_structured_query()` – Can be enhanced with GNN embeddings

**Current vs Target Implementation:**
- *Current Reality:* Placeholder implementations with "TODO" comments for graph operations
- *Target:* Replace stubbed graph operations with GNN-based intelligence
- *Performance Goal:* Achieve <2s response time through intelligent expansion

This analysis confirms the architecture is ready for GNN integration, and highlights exactly where to plug in GNN-driven logic for maximum impact.

## Minimum Steps for GNN Integration

### 1. Prepare MaintIE Data for GNN
- Export MaintIE’s entity/relation graph in a format suitable for GNN libraries (e.g., PyTorch Geometric, DGL, or NetworkX for prototyping).
- **Action:** Add a script to convert your processed data to edge/node lists.

### 2. Prototype a GNN Model
- Implement a simple GNN (e.g., GraphSAGE, GCN) for node classification or link prediction using MaintIE data.
- Use existing libraries (PyTorch Geometric, DGL).
- **Action:** Start with a notebook or script for GNN training/inference.

### 3. Integrate GNN into Query Understanding
- Add a module/class in your pipeline that, given a user query, uses the GNN to:
  - Classify/query nodes (entities/relations) relevant to the query.
  - Suggest related concepts/entities for semantic expansion.
- **Action:** Add a `GNNQueryExpander` class and call it in the query processing pipeline.

### 4. Plug GNN Expansion into RAG Pipeline
- In your query analyzer or expansion step, call the GNN module to get expanded concepts/entities.
- Use these for downstream retrieval and context assembly.
- **Action:** Replace or augment the current expansion logic with GNN outputs.

### 5. (Optional) Expose GNN Results in API
- Optionally, add a debug endpoint to return GNN-inferred expansions for a given query.

## Strategic Implementation: Phased Approach

**Based on the current codebase and project status, the GNN idea should be phased in strategically for maximum impact.**

### Phase 1: Fix Performance Bottleneck (Weeks 1-2) ✅ Priority
- **Goal:** Achieve immediate performance gains by optimizing the structured retrieval pipeline.
- **Action:**
  - Replace 3 vector searches with 1 vector search + NetworkX graph operations.
  - Implement and connect `get_related_entities()` and graph-based ranking in `rag_structured.py`.
- **Example:**
```python
# backend/src/pipeline/rag_structured.py
vector_results = self.vector_search.search(query)  # 1 API call
related_entities = self.transformer.get_related_entities(entities, max_distance=2)
enhanced_results = self.graph_ranker.rank(vector_results, related_entities)
```
- **Value:** 3x-4x performance improvement with existing infrastructure.

### Phase 2: Graph Operation Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)
- **Goal:** Use the existing NetworkX graph for domain-aware query expansion.
- **Action:**
  - Implement a `GraphQueryExpander` class to expand queries using graph relationships.
- **Example:**
```python
class GraphQueryExpander:
    def expand_query(self, entities, concepts):
        expanded_entities = []
        for entity in entities:
            related = self.knowledge_graph.get_related_entities(entity, max_distance=2)
            expanded_entities.extend(related)
        return expanded_entities
```
- **Value:** Domain-aware query expansion using structured relationships.

### Phase 3: GNN Enhancement (Weeks 5-8) 🎯
- **Goal:** Add GNN intelligence for advanced query understanding and expansion.
- **Action:**
  - Train a GNN on the MaintIE graph for better entity classification and semantic expansion.
  - Integrate a `GNNQueryAnalyzer` for intelligent query understanding.
- **Example:**
```python
class GNNQueryAnalyzer:
    def understand_query(self, query_text):
        query_embeddings = self.gnn_model.encode_query(query_text)
        enhanced_understanding = self.gnn_model.predict_related_concepts(query_embeddings)
        return enhanced_understanding
```
- **Value:** Superior query understanding and expansion, fulfilling the original GNN vision.

---

### Why This Phased Approach Works
- **Code Priority Principle:** Fix bottlenecks first, enhance second.
- **Start Simple Principle:** Build from working NetworkX → enhanced NetworkX → GNN.
- **Professional Architecture:** Clean separation supports incremental improvement.
- **Good Lifecycle Workflow:** A/B test at each phase, maintain fallback options.
