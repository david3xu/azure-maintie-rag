## Proposed Intelligent RAG Workflow

### **Process Flow**
```
"pump seal failure"
→ Domain Understanding:
  ├── Equipment Type: "pump" (rotating_equipment)
  ├── Component: "seal" (mechanical_seal hierarchy)
  └── Issue Type: "failure" (troubleshooting context)
→ Structured Knowledge Activation:
  ├── Knowledge Graph Traversal: pump → mechanical_seal → O-ring → gasket
  ├── Relationship Discovery: hasPart, causes, participatesIn
  └── Context Enrichment: safety_critical, maintenance_procedure
→ Intelligent Retrieval:
  ├── Entity-Document Lookup: O(1) direct mapping
  ├── Graph-Enhanced Ranking: relationship relevance weighting
  └── Domain-Contextual Filtering: troubleshooting + rotating_equipment
→ Structured Response Assembly
