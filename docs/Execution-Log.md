# 📝 Execution Log: MaintIE Enhanced RAG Backend

This document records the process of running and validating the MaintIE Enhanced RAG backend, including errors and fixes.

---

## 1. Initial Run Attempt

**Command:**

```bash
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Result:**

- Uvicorn server started, but crashed with a traceback.
- Error message:
  > `pydantic.errors.PydanticImportError: BaseSettings has been moved to the pydantic-settings package.`

**Diagnosis:**

- Pydantic v2+ moved `BaseSettings` to a new package: `pydantic-settings`.
- The codebase imports `BaseSettings` from `pydantic`, which is not compatible with the installed version.

---

## 2. Next Steps

- [x] Update the codebase to use `pydantic-settings` for configuration management.
- [x] Update `requirements.txt` to include `pydantic-settings`.
- [x] Re-run the server and record the outcome.

---

## 3. Environment Issues

- Attempted to activate `venv/bin/activate`, but the directory does not exist.
- Created a new virtual environment and reinstalled dependencies.

---

## 4. OpenAI SDK Migration & Azure Integration

- Migrated all LLM and embedding code to use the latest OpenAI SDK (`openai>=1.13.3`) and the new `AzureOpenAI` client interface.
- Updated all config fields to match the new SDK and Azure OpenAI requirements.
- Updated API version in `.env` and config to `2025-03-01-preview` (latest as of July 2025).

---

## 5. Embedding API Error & Robustness

- On startup, the backend attempts to build a vector index for 7000 documents using Azure OpenAI embeddings.
- The embedding API call fails with:
  > `Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "'$.input' is invalid. Please check the API reference: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference.", ...}`
- Diagnosis: Azure OpenAI embedding endpoint has a batch size limit (max 2048 inputs/request for embedding-3). Sending 7000 at once fails.
- Added robust error handling: if index build fails, the backend logs a warning but continues to run and serve all endpoints.

---

## 6. Server Health & Endpoint Verification

- FastAPI server runs and serves `/docs` and all API endpoints.
- LLM (chat/completions) works with Azure OpenAI.
- Vector search is available, but index build is skipped if embedding batch fails.
- All config and initialization errors are fixed.

---

## 7. Direct Azure OpenAI API Testing (curl)

- Provided ready-to-use `curl` commands to test both embedding and chat endpoints directly.
- **Best practice:** Use an environment variable for your API key to avoid exposing secrets in your shell history or logs.

**Before running the curl commands, export your real API key:**

```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-real-azure-openai-key"
```

**Embeddings:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://clu-project-foundry-instance.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/text-embedding-ada-002/embeddings?api-version=2025-03-01-preview" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Hello, this is a test for Azure OpenAI embeddings!"
  }'
```

**Chat:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://clu-project-foundry-instance.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4.1/chat/completions?api-version=2025-03-01-preview" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "When was Microsoft founded?"}
    ]
  }'



cd /home/azureuser/workspace/azure-maintie-rag/backend && source .venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/knowledge/


cd /home/azureuser/workspace/azure-maintie-rag/backend && source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

```




---

## 8. Next Steps

- [ ] Implement batching for embedding requests (≤2048 per call) in vector search code.
- [ ] Confirm API version in `.env` matches Azure portal (should be `2025-03-01-preview`).
- [ ] Rebuild vector index after batching fix.
- [ ] Validate all endpoints with real data.

---

**Current Status:**

- Backend is robust and runs with all endpoints available.
- LLM (chat) works with Azure OpenAI.
- Vector search index build fails gracefully if batch size is too large, but does not crash the server.
- Ready for final embedding batching fix and production use.

{
    "query": "How to troubleshoot pump seal failure?",
    "response": "\n\n⚠️ **SAFETY WARNINGS:**\n- Rotating equipment safety - ensure complete stop\n- Electrical hazard - ensure proper lockout/tagout procedures\n- Pressure hazard - properly isolate and depressurize system\n- Temperature hazard - allow equipment to cool and use appropriate PPE\n- Chemical hazard - review MSDS and use proper containment\n\n**TROUBLESHOOTING RESPONSE: Pump Seal Failure**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Systematic Troubleshooting Approach\n\nA structured approach ensures thorough diagnosis and minimizes risk of repeated failures:\n\n1. **Isolate and Secure:** Ensure the pump is safely isolated from power and process.\n2. **Visual Inspection:** Look for obvious signs of leakage or damage.\n3. **Operational Review:** Assess recent pump operation, maintenance history, and any abnormal events.\n4. **Root Cause Analysis:** Systematically check probable causes, starting with the most common.\n5. **Corrective Action:** Address root cause(s) before replacing or repairing the seal.\n6. **Verification:** Test after repair to confirm resolution.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Most Likely Causes Ranked by Probability\n\n1. **Incorrect Seal Installation or Alignment**\n2. **Seal Wear Due to Normal Operation (End-of-Life)**\n3. **Dry Running (Loss of Pumped Fluid)**\n4. **Process Upsets (Pressure/Temperature Spikes)**\n5. **Improper Seal Material for Service Conditions**\n6. **Shaft Misalignment or Excessive Vibration**\n7. **Contaminated or Abrasive Fluid**\n8. **Improper Lubrication (for packed seals)**\n9. **Damaged or Worn Shaft/Sleeve**\n10. **Improper Gland Packing (if applicable)**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Diagnostic Procedures\n\n#### A. Safety First\n- Lock out/tag out (LOTO) the pump and associated systems.\n- Verify zero energy state (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic).\n- Allow pump to cool if handling hot fluids.\n\n#### B. Visual and Physical Inspection\n1. **Check for Leakage:**\n   - Identify location and extent of leakage (seal faces, gland, drain).\n2. **Inspect Seal Area:**\n   - Look for signs of scoring, pitting, or discoloration on seal faces and shaft/sleeve.\n3. **Assess Pump Environment:**\n   - Check for evidence of dry running (burnt smell, discoloration).\n   - Inspect for process fluid compatibility issues (swelling, cracking).\n\n#### C. Operational Review\n4. **Review Recent Events:**\n   - Any recent start-ups, shutdowns, process upsets, or maintenance?\n5. **Check Pump Parameters:**\n   - Review pressure, temperature, flow rates, and vibration logs.\n\n#### D. Mechanical Checks\n6. **Check Shaft\n\n**Response Confidence:** Medium (0.70)",
