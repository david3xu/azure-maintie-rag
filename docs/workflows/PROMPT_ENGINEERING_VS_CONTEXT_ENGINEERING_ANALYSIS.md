## üö® Critical Issues with Current Approach

### **Constraining Prompt Engineering (Current - BROKEN)**

#### Example of Current Bad Prompts:
```jinja2
# Current entity extraction prompt
**Required Output Format:**
Return ONLY a JSON array of strings containing the entity names:
```json
["entity1", "entity2", "entity3", ...]
```

**Important:** 
- NO explanations or additional text
- NO categorization or classification
- ONLY the JSON array of discovered entity names
- Maximum {{ max_entities|default(50) }} entities
```

#### Problems with This Approach:
1. **‚ùå Artificial Limits**: "Maximum 50 entities" constrains discovery
2. **‚ùå Loss of Context**: "NO explanations" removes valuable information
3. **‚ùå Wrong Granularity**: Asks for entity **types**, not **instances** 
4. **‚ùå No Quality Metrics**: No confidence scoring or validation
5. **‚ùå Poor Structure**: Simple string array loses semantic richness

#### Real Results from Current Approach:
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity_id": "entity_0",
      "text": "location",           // ‚ùå Generic, meaningless
      "entity_type": "location", 
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "context": "",             // ‚ùå Empty context!
      "metadata": {...}
    },
    {
      "entity_id": "entity_1", 
      "text": "specification",    // ‚ùå Generic, meaningless
      "entity_type": "specification",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "context": "",             // ‚ùå Empty context!
      "metadata": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

**This is completely useless for GNN training!**

## ‚úÖ Context Engineering Solution

### **Core Concept: Guide, Don't Constrain**

Instead of constraining the LLM with rigid rules, we provide **rich context** that helps the LLM understand:
- **Domain knowledge** about maintenance
- **Quality expectations** for extraction
- **Use case context** for the knowledge graph
- **Examples of good reasoning**

### **Context-Aware Entity Extraction**

#### New Approach:
```jinja2
## Context: Maintenance Knowledge Extraction

**Your Role**: You're helping build an intelligent maintenance knowledge system that will help technicians quickly find solutions to equipment problems.

**Domain Knowledge**: You understand that maintenance records contain:
- **Equipment**: Primary systems (air conditioner, compressor, engine, pump)
- **Components**: Parts within equipment (thermostat, valve, hose, bearing, filter)
- **Problems**: Issues that occur (not working, unserviceable, blown, cracked, leaking)
- **Locations**: Where issues occur (left hand, near side, position, on, off)
- **Actions**: What needs to be done (replace, repair, check, service, analyse)
- **Conditions**: States and measurements (pressure, temperature, worn, seized)

**Quality Standards**: Extract entities that would help a maintenance technician understand:
1. What equipment is involved?
2. What specific components are affected?
3. What problems are occurring?
4. Where the problems are located?
5. What actions are needed?
```

#### Key Improvements:
1. **‚úÖ Rich Context**: LLM understands the maintenance domain
2. **‚úÖ Purpose-Driven**: Extraction serves technician needs
3. **‚úÖ Quality Guidance**: Clear standards for what makes a good entity
4. **‚úÖ No Artificial Limits**: Extract all meaningful entities
5. **‚úÖ Semantic Richness**: Full context and confidence scoring

### **Expected Output Quality**

#### Context-Aware Results:
```json
[
  {
    "entity_id": "entity_1",
    "text": "air conditioner",           // ‚úÖ Specific, meaningful
    "entity_type": "cooling_equipment",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "context": "air conditioner thermostat not working",  // ‚úÖ Rich context!
    "source_record": 1,
    "semantic_role": "primary_system",
    "maintenance_relevance": "equipment requiring service"
  },
  {
    "entity_id": "entity_2", 
    "text": "thermostat",               // ‚úÖ Specific component
    "entity_type": "temperature_control_component",
    "confidence": 0.90,
    "context": "air conditioner thermostat not working",  // ‚úÖ Rich context!
    "source_record": 1,
    "semantic_role": "component",
    "maintenance_relevance": "component with problem"
  }
]
```

## üìä Comparison Analysis

### **Quantitative Differences**

| Aspect | Constraining Prompts | Context Engineering | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Entity Quality** | Generic ("location", "specification") | Specific ("air_conditioner", "thermostat") | **10x more meaningful** |
| **Context Preservation** | Empty context fields | Full source text context | **Complete context** |
| **Extraction Scope** | 50 entities total (all texts) | ~3-5 entities per text | **5-10x more entities** |
| **Semantic Richness** | Simple string array | Structured objects with roles | **Rich semantic data** |
| **Confidence Scoring** | Fixed 0.8 for all | Dynamic based on clarity | **Accurate quality assessment** |
| **Relationship Context** | No entity instances | Specific entity relationships | **Meaningful graph structure** |

### **Qualitative Improvements**

#### **Old Approach Problems**:
```
‚ùå "Return ONLY a JSON array" ‚Üí Loses semantic information

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### **Context-Aware Template Structure**

#### 1. Role and Purpose Context
```jinja2
**Your Role**: You're helping build an intelligent maintenance knowledge system...
**Domain Knowledge**: You understand that maintenance records contain...
**Quality Standards**: Extract entities that would help a maintenance technician...
```

#### 2. Domain-Specific Guidance
```jinja2
- **Equipment**: Primary systems (air conditioner, compressor, engine, pump)
- **Components**: Parts within equipment (thermostat, valve, hose, bearing, filter)
- **Problems**: Issues that occur (not working, unserviceable, blown, cracked, leaking)
```

#### 3. Quality-Focused Output Format
```jinja2
**Guidelines for Quality Extraction**:
- Extract entities exactly as they appear in the maintenance records
- Assign confidence scores based on how clearly the entity is mentioned
- Provide the full context where the entity appears
- Choose entity types that make sense for maintenance work
```

### **Relationship Context Engineering**

#### Problem-Solution Mapping:
```jinja2
**Maintenance Relationship Patterns**: Based on your engineering expertise, you know that maintenance records typically contain:

**Structural Relationships**:
- `has_component`: Equipment contains components (air conditioner has thermostat)
- `part_of`: Components belong to larger systems (bearing part of compressor)

**Problem Relationships**:
- `has_problem`: Entity experiencing an issue (thermostat has problem not working)
- `causes`: One problem leads to another (low pressure causes malfunction)

**Maintenance Action Relationships**:
- `requires_action`: Problem needs specific action (blown hose requires replacement)
```

## üéØ Expected Performance Improvements

### **Entity Extraction Quality**

#### Before (Constraining):
- 50 generic entities total across all texts
- No meaningful context
- Fixed confidence scores
- Generic types like "location", "specification"

#### After (Context-Aware):
- 3-5 specific entities per text (150-250 total for 50 texts)
- Rich context for each entity
- Dynamic confidence based on text clarity
- Specific types like "cooling_equipment", "temperature_control_component"

### **Relationship Extraction Quality**

#### Before (Constraining):
- 30 relationship types total
- No specific instances
- No confidence scoring
- Generic relationships

#### After (Context-Aware):
- 2-3 relationships per text (100-150 total for 50 texts)
- Specific entity pairs with context
- Confidence based on relationship clarity
- Maintenance-relevant relationships

### **GNN Training Impact**

#### Data Quality for Training:
```python
# Old approach - unusable for training
entities = ["location", "specification", "light"]  # Generic, meaningless
context = ["", "", ""]  # No context

# New approach - rich training data
entities = ["air_conditioner", "thermostat", "not_working"]  # Specific, meaningful
context = ["air conditioner thermostat not working", ...]  # Rich context for semantic embeddings
```

#### Feature Engineering Impact:
```python
# Old: Semantic embeddings of generic terms
embedding("location") ‚Üí [-0.001, 0.023, ...]  # Poor semantic content

# New: Semantic embeddings of specific maintenance entities
embedding("air conditioner thermostat not working") ‚Üí [0.234, -0.456, ...]  # Rich semantic content
```
