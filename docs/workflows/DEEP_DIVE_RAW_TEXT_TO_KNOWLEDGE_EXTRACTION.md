## üöÄ The Challenge: From Chaos to Structure

### Input: Raw Maintenance Text Data
**Location**: `backend/data/raw/maintenance_all_texts.md`

#### Real Data Examples
```text
<id> air conditioner thermostat not working
<id> air conditioner thermostat unserviceable  
<id> air conditioner unserviceable when stationary
<id> air horn not working compressor awaiting
<id> air horn working intermittently
<id> air leak near side of door
<id> alternator overcharge fault
<id> auto-greaser control unit
<id> axle temperature sensor fault
<id> back rest unserviceable handle broken
<id> bearing on air conditioner compressor unserviceable
<id> blade light blown needs replacing
<id> blown air conditioner hose
<id> blown crowd cylinder hose
<id> blown o-ring off steering hose
<id> boilermaker repairs to bucket assembly
```

#### The Fundamental Problem
- **5,254 unstructured records**: No standardized format, inconsistent terminology
- **No searchability**: Can only find exact text matches
- **No relationships**: No understanding of how equipment connects to problems
- **No solutions**: Text describes problems but not typical fixes
- **No patterns**: Cannot identify common issues across records
- **Domain complexity**: Heavy machinery maintenance has specialized vocabulary

### Why Traditional NLP Fails
```
‚ùå Keyword Search: "air conditioner" ‚Üí Only finds exact matches
‚ùå Simple NER: Identifies "air conditioner" as entity but misses relationships
‚ùå Rule-based: Cannot handle "blown o-ring off steering hose" variations  
‚ùå Pattern Matching: Fails on "bearing on air conditioner compressor unserviceable"
‚ùå Statistical Models: Need massive labeled training data
```

**The Need**: Transform this chaos into **structured knowledge** that machines can reason with.

### Core Components

#### 1. Text Preprocessing Pipeline
**Purpose**: Clean and normalize raw maintenance texts for optimal extraction

**Implementation**: `backend/core/azure_openai/text_processor.py`

```python
class AzureOpenAITextProcessor:
    def clean_maintenance_text(self, raw_text: str) -> str:
        # Remove ID markers
        text = re.sub(r'<id>\s*', '', raw_text.strip())
        
        # Normalize technical terms
        text = self.normalize_technical_vocabulary(text)
        
        # Handle abbreviations
        text = self.expand_maintenance_abbreviations(text)
        
        # Standardize equipment names
        text = self.standardize_equipment_terms(text)
        
        return text
```

**Real Example**:
```python
# Input
"<id> blown o-ring off steering hose"

# After preprocessing  
"blown o-ring component off steering hose assembly"
```

#### 2. Azure OpenAI Entity Extraction
**Service**: Azure OpenAI GPT-4  
**Implementation**: `backend/core/prompt_flow/prompt_flow_integration.py`

##### Prompt Engineering Strategy
```python
ENTITY_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert maintenance engineer analyzing equipment maintenance records.

Extract entities from this maintenance text with the following guidelines:

EQUIPMENT ENTITIES:
- Primary equipment (air conditioner, compressor, engine)
- Components (thermostat, hose, valve, sensor)  
- Sub-components (o-ring, filter, bearing)

PROBLEM ENTITIES:
- Failure states (not working, unserviceable, blown, cracked)
- Symptoms (intermittent, overcharge, low pressure)
- Conditions (when stationary, seized, worn)

LOCATION ENTITIES:
- Physical positions (left hand, right hand, near side)
- Relative positions (off, on, from, to)

ACTION ENTITIES:
- Maintenance actions (replace, repair, check, service)
- Analysis actions (analyse, inspect, test)

For each entity provide:
1. Entity text (normalized form)
2. Entity type (equipment/component/problem/location/action)  
3. Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
4. Context (surrounding words that help understanding)

Maintenance Text: "{text}"

Return JSON format:
{{
  "entities": [
    {{
      "text": "air_conditioner",
      "entity_type": "equipment",

##### Automatic Quality Metrics
```python
class ExtractionQualityAssessment:
    def assess_extraction_quality(self, entities, relations, original_text):
        quality_metrics = {
            "entity_coverage": self.calculate_entity_coverage(entities, original_text),
            "relationship_coherence": self.assess_relationship_logic(relations),

    },
    "domain_consistency": 0.92,  // Vocabulary fits maintenance domain
    "extraction_completeness": 0.90,  // Key information captured
    "overall_quality_score": 0.91
  }

## üî¨ Technical Deep-Dive: GPT-4 Processing

### Prompt Engineering Innovations

#### Multi-Stage Extraction Strategy
```python
# Stage 1: Entity Extraction with Context
entity_prompt = """
Analyze maintenance text as expert engineer.
Extract: equipment, components, problems, actions, locations.
Provide confidence scores and contextual reasoning.
"""

# Stage 2: Relationship Extraction with Logic
relationship_prompt = """  
From extracted entities, identify logical relationships.
Focus on: structural, problem, action, location relationships.
Validate: does this relationship make engineering sense?
"""

# Stage 3: Quality Assessment
quality_prompt = """
Assess extraction quality:
- Coverage: did we capture all important information?
- Accuracy: are entities and relationships correct?
- Completeness: are we missing critical connections?
"""
```

#### Context-Aware Processing
**Innovation**: Each extraction considers full maintenance context, not just isolated entities

**Example**:
```
Text: "blown o-ring off steering hose"

Standard NER Output:
- Entities: ["o-ring", "steering", "hose"]
- No relationships

Our Context-Aware Output:
- Entities: ["o_ring", "steering_system", "hydraulic_hose", "blown"]
- Relationships: [
    "steering_system ‚Üí has_component ‚Üí hydraulic_hose",
    "hydraulic_hose ‚Üí has_component ‚Üí o_ring", 
    "o_ring ‚Üí has_problem ‚Üí blown",
    "blown ‚Üí requires_action ‚Üí replacement"
  ]
```

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Confidence Calibration
```python
def calibrate_confidence(entity_text, context, domain):
    """Adjust confidence based on domain knowledge and context clarity"""
    
    base_confidence = gpt4_confidence_score
    
    # Boost confidence for well-known equipment
    if entity_text in COMMON_EQUIPMENT:
        base_confidence += 0.1
    
    # Reduce confidence for ambiguous terms
    if entity_text in AMBIGUOUS_TERMS:
        base_confidence -= 0.15
        
    # Context clarity adjustment
    context_clarity = assess_context_clarity(context)
    base_confidence *= context_clarity
    
    return min(max(base_confidence, 0.0), 1.0)
```

#### 2. Terminology Standardization
```python
def standardize_maintenance_terminology(raw_entity):

#### 3. Relationship Validation
```python
def validate_relationship_logic(source, target, relation_type, domain="maintenance"):
    """Ensure relationships make engineering sense"""
    
    validation_rules = {
        "has_component": lambda s, t: is_equipment(s) and is_component(t),
        "has_problem": lambda s, t: is_physical_entity(s) and is_problem_state(t),
        "requires_action": lambda s, t: is_problem(s) and is_maintenance_action(t),
        "connected_to": lambda s, t: is_physical_entity(s) and is_physical_entity(t)
    }
    
    if relation_type in validation_rules:
        return validation_rules[relation_type](source, target)
    
    return True  # Allow unknown relationship types
