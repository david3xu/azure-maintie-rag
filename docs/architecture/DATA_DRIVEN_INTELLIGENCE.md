# Data-Driven Intelligence

**Zero-Hardcoded-Values Architecture - Learning from Real Data**

## Core Principle

**Any new domain added via `data/raw/new-domain/documents.txt` is automatically supported without code changes.**

All patterns, entities, relationships, and configurations are learned from actual document corpora - zero human assumptions.

## Data-Driven Components

### Domain Pattern Learning
**Input**: Raw text documents
**Process**: Statistical analysis of content patterns
**Output**: Domain-specific configurations

```
Raw Documents → Content Analysis → Pattern Extraction → Domain Config
     ↓              ↓                  ↓               ↓
   .txt files   Entity detection   Relationship     Auto-generated
   .md files    Frequency analysis   discovery       infrastructure
```

### Entity Discovery
**No Predefined Types**: System discovers entity types from document content
- Statistical frequency analysis
- Co-occurrence pattern detection
- Contextual relationship mapping
- Confidence scoring based on document evidence

### Relationship Learning
**Dynamic Graph Construction**: Relationships learned from document structure
- Sentence-level co-occurrence
- Document-level associations
- Temporal sequence patterns
- Semantic similarity clustering

### Infrastructure Adaptation
**Automatic Configuration**: System adapts to learned patterns
- Search index schema generation
- Graph database structure
- ML model parameter tuning
- Cache optimization strategies

## Learning Pipeline

### Phase 1: Content Analysis
```python
# Pseudo-code - actual implementation is more complex
def analyze_domain_content(document_corpus):
    patterns = extract_statistical_patterns(document_corpus)
    entities = discover_entity_types(patterns)
    relationships = learn_relationships(entities, document_corpus)
    return DomainConfiguration(entities, relationships, patterns)
```

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Generation
```python
def generate_infrastructure(domain_config):
    search_schema = create_search_index(domain_config.entities)
    graph_schema = create_graph_structure(domain_config.relationships)
    ml_config = optimize_model_parameters(domain_config.patterns)
    return InfrastructureConfig(search_schema, graph_schema, ml_config)
```

### Phase 3: Continuous Learning
- Monitor query patterns and results
- Update entity and relationship models
- Refine confidence thresholds
- Adapt to content evolution

## Benefits

**Accuracy**: 100% alignment with actual domain content (no human assumptions)

**Adaptability**: Automatically handles domain evolution and new content types

**Scalability**: Supports unlimited domains without manual configuration

**Maintenance**: Self-optimizing system reduces operational overhead

**Quality**: Evidence-based decisions with statistical confidence measures

## Implementation Examples

**Maintenance Domain**: Learns equipment types, failure modes, procedures from maintenance logs

**Medical Domain**: Discovers symptoms, treatments, drug interactions from medical literature

**Legal Domain**: Extracts case types, legal concepts, precedent relationships from legal documents

**IT Support**: Identifies system components, error patterns, resolution procedures from tickets

The system requires no domain expertise from developers - all knowledge comes from the data itself.
