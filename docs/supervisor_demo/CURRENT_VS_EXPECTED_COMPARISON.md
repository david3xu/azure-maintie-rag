## 🔄 **Multi-Hop Enhancement: Current vs Expected**

### **1. Graph Path Discovery**

#### **Current Implementation** ✅
```python
# File: backend/core/azure_cosmos/cosmos_gremlin_client.py:244-273
def find_entity_paths(self, start_entity, target_entity, max_hops=3):
    query = f"""
    g.V().has('text', '{start_entity}')
    .repeat(outE().inV().simplePath())
    .times({max_hops})
    """
    return self.execute_query(query)
```

**What This Does**: Finds graph paths between entities
**Demo Result**: Returns entity → entity → entity paths
**Limitation**: No semantic scoring, no query context

#### **Expected Enhancement** 🔄
```python
def find_context_aware_paths(self, start_entity, target_entity, query_context, max_hops=3):
    paths = self.find_entity_paths(start_entity, target_entity, max_hops)
    
    # NEW: Use existing 1540-dim embeddings for path scoring
    scored_paths = []
    for path in paths:
        relevance_score = self.score_path_relevance(path, query_context)
        if relevance_score > self.quality_threshold:
            scored_paths.append((path, relevance_score))
    
    return sorted(scored_paths, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

**Enhancement Value**: Context-aware path selection using existing infrastructure
**Implementation Effort**: 2-3 days (builds on existing SemanticFeatureEngine)

---

### **2. Query Processing Integration**

#### **Current Implementation** ✅
```python
# File: backend/core/orchestration/rag_orchestration_service.py
async def process_query(self, query: str, domain: str):
    # Sequential service calls
    search_results = await self.search_service.search(query)
    graph_entities = await self.cosmos_service.find_entities(query)
    response = await self.openai_service.generate_response(search_results)
    return response
```

**What This Does**: Processes queries using multiple Azure services
**Demo Result**: Comprehensive responses with citations
**Limitation**: No intelligent fusion of multi-hop evidence

#### **Expected Enhancement** 🔄
```python
async def process_multihop_query(self, query: str, domain: str):
    # Current functionality
    search_results = await self.search_service.search(query)
    
    # NEW: Context-aware multi-hop traversal
    query_entities = self.extract_query_entities(query)
    multihop_paths = []
    for entity in query_entities:
        paths = await self.cosmos_service.find_context_aware_paths(
            entity, query_context=query, max_hops=3
        )
        multihop_paths.extend(paths)
    
    # NEW: Intelligent evidence fusion
    enhanced_context = self.fuse_evidence(search_results, multihop_paths)
    response = await self.openai_service.generate_response(enhanced_context)
    
    return {
        "response": response,
        "multihop_reasoning": multihop_paths,
        "evidence_sources": enhanced_context
    }
```

**Enhancement Value**: Multi-hop reasoning integrated with existing pipeline
**Implementation Effort**: 3-4 days (builds on existing enhanced_pipeline.py patterns)

---

### **3. Semantic Path Scoring**

#### **Current Implementation** ❌ **Missing**
- No semantic relevance scoring for graph paths
- All relationships weighted equally (confidence = 1.0)
- No query context consideration in path selection

#### **Expected Enhancement** 🔄
```python
# NEW: Integrate existing SemanticFeatureEngine
class ContextAwarePathScorer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Use existing infrastructure
        self.feature_engine = SemanticFeatureEngine()  # Already exists
        self.quality_thresholds = self.load_quality_config()  # Already exists
    
    def score_path_relevance(self, path: List[str], query_context: str) -> float:
        # Generate embeddings for path and query
        path_embedding = self.feature_engine.generate_path_embedding(path)
        query_embedding = self.feature_engine.generate_query_embedding(query_context)
        
        # Calculate semantic similarity
        similarity = self.calculate_similarity(path_embedding, query_embedding)
        
        # Apply existing quality thresholds
        if similarity > self.quality_thresholds['semantic_similarity']:
            return similarity
        return 0.0
```

**Enhancement Value**: Leverages existing 1540-dimensional embeddings for path intelligence
**Implementation Effort**: 2-3 days (integrates existing components)
