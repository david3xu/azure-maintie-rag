## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Pre-flight Validation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Azure CLI Authentication**: Working (Microsoft Azure Sponsorship)
- **Azure Service Status**: 4/4 services healthy
- **Environment Variables**: All 48 configuration values present
- **Data Availability**: 17 real Azure AI Language Service files (0.16 MB)

### 2. Critical Issue Resolution ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Issue Identified**: PydanticAI 0.6.2 `Cannot instantiate typing.Union` error

**Root Cause**: OpenAI client typing incompatibility with PydanticAI tool system

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Removed `deps_type=UniversalDeps` parameter (redundant in PydanticAI 0.6.2)
2. Updated Azure OpenAI API version from `2024-06-01` to `2024-08-01-preview`
3. Used `PromptedOutput()` wrapper instead of bare structured output
4. Temporarily disabled agent tools to avoid typing.Union instantiation
5. Added `content_signature` property to `UniversalDomainAnalysis` for API compatibility

### 3. Data Processing Validation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Real Data Test Results**:
```
üìä Multi-File Processing: 5 Azure AI files
‚úÖ Success Rate: 100% (5/5 files)
üìà Average Confidence: 0.91 (91%)
üìà Average Vocab Complexity: 0.53
üìà Average Concept Density: 0.35
üîë Unique Signatures: 5 (perfect differentiation)
```

**Sample Results**:
- `part_82.md`: Signature `fa674e9d...` (93% confidence)
- `part_121.md`: Signature `193cb29e...` (87% confidence)  
- `part_138.md`: Signature `4c6f602c...` (92% confidence)
- `part_70.md`: Signature `f64267db...` (92% confidence)
- `part_137.md`: Signature `8ddb41f6...` (92% confidence)

### 4. Performance Analysis ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS OPTIMIZATION

**Performance Test Results**:
```
Small Content (500 chars):   5.73s average (Target: <3.0s)
Medium Content (1500 chars): 5.94s average (Target: <3.0s) 
Large Content (3000 chars):  6.10s average (Target: <3.0s)

SLA Compliance: 0/3 tests meet sub-3-second target
```

**Performance Issues**:
- Processing times 5.73-6.10 seconds exceed 3-second SLA
- Azure OpenAI response times contributing to latency
- PromptedOutput mode may be slower than native tools

**Optimization Recommendations**:
1. Implement caching for repeated content analysis
2. Optimize prompt templates for faster processing
3. Consider parallel processing for large documents
4. Resolve typing.Union issue to use faster tool-based output
