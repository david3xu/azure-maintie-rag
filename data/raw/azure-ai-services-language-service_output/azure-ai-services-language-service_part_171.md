Optional Configuration
\nOptional keyword arguments can be passed in at the client and per-operation level.
The
azure-core reference documentation

describes available configurations for retries,
logging, transport protocols, and more.
The Text Analytics client will raise exceptions defined in Azure Core
.
This library uses the standard
logging
 library for logging.
Basic information about
HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFO
level.
Detailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredacted
headers, can be enabled on a client with the logging_enable keyword argument:
Python
Similarly, logging_enable can enable detailed logging for a single operation,
even when
it isn't enabled for the client:
Troubleshooting
General
Logging
import sys
import logging
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
# Create a logger for the 'azure' SDK
logger = logging.getLogger('azure')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
# Configure a console output
handler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)
logger.addHandler(handler)
endpoint = "https://<resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
# This client will log detailed information about its HTTP sessions, at 
DEBUG level
text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential, 
logging_enable=True)
result = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(["I did not like the 
restaurant. The food was too spicy."])

Azure Cognitive Language Services
Question Answering client library for
Python - version 1.1.0b2
Question Answering is a cloud-based API service that lets you create a conversational
question-and-answer layer over your existing data. Use it to build a knowledge base by
extracting questions and answers from your semi-structured content, including FAQ,
manuals, and documents. Answer usersâ€™ questions with the best answers from the QnAs
in your knowledge baseâ€”automatically. Your knowledge base gets smarter, too, as it
continually learns from users' behavior.

Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 ended 01 January 2022. For more
information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-
python/issues/20691
Python 3.6 or later is required to use this package.
An Azure subscription
A Language Service resource
Install the Azure QuestionAnswering client library for Python with pip
:
Bash
Disclaimer
Getting started
Prerequisites
Install the package
pip install azure-ai-language-questionanswering --pre
\nIn order to interact with the Question Answering service, you'll need to create an
instance of the QuestionAnsweringClient
 class or an instance of the
QuestionAnsweringProjectsClient
 for managing projects within your resource. You will
need an endpoint, and an API key to instantiate a client object. For more information
regarding authenticating with Cognitive Services, see Authenticate requests to Azure
Cognitive Services.
You can get the endpoint and an API key from the Cognitive Services resource or
Question Answering resource in the Azure Portal
.
Alternatively, use the Azure CLI command shown below to get the API key from the
Question Answering resource.
PowerShell
Once you've determined your endpoint and API key you can instantiate a
QuestionAnsweringClient :
Python
With your endpoint and API key, you can instantiate a
QuestionAnsweringProjectsClient
:
Python
Authenticate the client
Get an API key
az cognitiveservices account keys list --resource-group <resource-group-
name> --name <resource-name>
Create QuestionAnsweringClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering import QuestionAnsweringClient
endpoint = "https://{myaccount}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com"
credential = AzureKeyCredential("{api-key}")
client = QuestionAnsweringClient(endpoint, credential)
Create QuestionAnsweringProjectsClient
\nTo use an Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential, provide an instance of the
desired credential type obtained from the azure-identity
 library. Note that regional
endpoints do not support AAD authentication. Create a custom subdomain name for
your resource in order to use this type of authentication.
Authentication with AAD requires some initial setup:
Install azure-identity
Register a new AAD application
Grant access to the Language service by assigning the "Cognitive Services
Language Reader" role to your service principal.
After setup, you can choose which type of credential
 from azure.identity to use. As an
example, DefaultAzureCredential
 can be used to authenticate the client:
Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as
environment variables: AZURE_CLIENT_ID , AZURE_TENANT_ID , AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
Use the returned token credential to authenticate the client:
Python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.language.questionanswering.projects import 
QuestionAnsweringProjectsClient
endpoint = "https://{myaccount}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com"
credential = AzureKeyCredential("{api-key}")
client = QuestionAnsweringProjectsClient(endpoint, credential)
Create a client with an Azure Active Directory Credential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import QuestionAnsweringClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = QuestionAnsweringClient(endpoint="https://<my-custom-
subdomain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/", credential=credential)
Key concepts
QuestionAnsweringClient
\nThe QuestionAnsweringClient
 is the primary interface for asking questions using a
knowledge base with your own information, or text input using pre-trained models. For
asynchronous operations, an async QuestionAnsweringClient  is in the
azure.ai.language.questionanswering.aio  namespace.
The QuestionAnsweringProjectsClient
 provides an interface for managing Question
Answering projects. Examples of the available operations include creating and deploying
projects, updating your knowledge sources, and updating question and answer pairs. It
provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs.
The azure-ai-language-questionanswering  client library provides both synchronous and
asynchronous APIs.
The following examples show common scenarios using the client  created above.
Ask a question
Ask a follow-up question
Asynchronous operations
The only input required to ask a question using a knowledge base is just the question
itself:
Python
QuestionAnsweringProjectsClient
Examples
QuestionAnsweringClient
Ask a question
output = client.get_answers(
    question="How long should my Surface battery last?",
    project_name="FAQ",
    deployment_name="test"
)
for candidate in output.answers:
    print("({}) {}".format(candidate.confidence, candidate.answer))
    print("Source: {}".format(candidate.source))
