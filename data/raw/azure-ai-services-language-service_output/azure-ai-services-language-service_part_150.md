SDK and REST developer guide for the
Language service
06/04/2025
Use this article to find information on integrating the Language service SDK and REST API into
your applications.
The Language service provides support through a REST API, and client libraries in several
languages.
The Language service provides three namespaces for using the available features.
Depending on which features and programming language you're using, you'll need to
download one or more of the following packages, and have the following
framework/language version support:
Framework/Language
Minimum supported version
.NET
.NET Framework 4.6.1  or newer, or .NET (formerly .NET Core) 2.0  or
newer.
Java
v8  or later
JavaScript
v14 LTS  or later
Python
v3.7  or later

If you're using custom named entity recognition or custom text classification, you will
need to create a project and train a model before using the SDK. The SDK only
provides the ability to analyze text using models you create. See the following
quickstarts for information on creating a model.

\nLanguage role-based access control
06/30/2025
Azure AI Language supports Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), an authorization
system for managing individual access to Azure resources. Using Azure RBAC, you assign
different team members different levels of permissions for your projects authoring resources.
See the Azure RBAC documentation for more information.
To use Azure RBAC, you must enable Microsoft Entra authentication. You can create a new
resource with a custom subdomain or create a custom subdomain for your existing resource.
Azure RBAC can be assigned to a Language resource. To grant access to an Azure resource, you
add a role assignment.
1. In the Azure portal
, select All services.
2. Select Azure AI services, and navigate to your specific Language resource.
3. Select Access control (IAM) on the left pane.
4. Select Add, then select Add role assignment.
5. On the Role tab on the next screen, select a role you want to add.
6. On the Members tab, select a user, group, service principal, or managed identity.
7. On the Review + assign tab, select Review + assign to assign the role.
Within a few minutes, the target will be assigned the selected role at the selected scope. For
help with these steps, see Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal.
Enable Microsoft Entra authentication
Add role assignment to Language resource
Ôºó Note
You can also set up Azure RBAC for whole resource groups, subscriptions, or
management groups. Do this by selecting the desired scope level and then
navigating to the desired item. For example, selecting Resource groups and then
navigating to a specific resource group.
\nUse the following table to determine access needs for your Language projects.
These custom roles only apply to Language resources.
A user that should only be validating and reviewing the Language apps, typically a tester to
ensure the application is performing well before deploying the project. They might want to
review the application‚Äôs assets to notify the app developers of any changes that need to be
made, but do not have direct access to make them. Readers will have access to view the
evaluation results.

\nA user that is responsible for building and modifying an application, as a collaborator in a
larger team. The collaborator can modify the Language apps in any way, train those changes,
and validate/test those changes in the portal. However, this user shouldn‚Äôt have access to
deploying this application to the runtime, as they might accidentally reflect their changes in
production. They also shouldn‚Äôt be able to delete the application or alter its prediction
resources and endpoint settings (assigning or unassigning prediction resources, making the
endpoint public). This restricts this role from altering an application currently being used in
production. They might also create new applications under this resource, but with the
restrictions mentioned.

\nMultilingual and emoji support in
Language service features
06/30/2025
Multilingual and emoji support has led to Unicode encodings that use more than one code
point
 to represent a single displayed character, called a grapheme. For example, emojis like
üå∑ and üëç may use several characters to compose the shape with additional characters for
visual attributes, such as skin tone. Similarly, the Hindi word ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•á‡§¶ is encoded as five letters
and three combining marks.
Because of the different lengths of possible multilingual and emoji encodings, Language
service features may return offsets in the response.
Whenever offsets are returned the API response, remember:
Elements in the response may be specific to the endpoint that was called.
HTTP POST/GET payloads are encoded in UTF-8
, which may or may not be the default
character encoding on your client-side compiler or operating system.
Offsets refer to grapheme counts based on the Unicode 8.0.0
 standard, not character
counts.
Offsets can cause problems when using character-based substring methods, for example the
.NET substring() method. One problem is that an offset may cause a substring method to end
in the middle of a multi-character grapheme encoding instead of the end.
In .NET, consider using the StringInfo class, which enables you to work with a string as a series
of textual elements, rather than individual character objects. You can also look for grapheme
splitter libraries in your preferred software environment.
The Language service features returns these textual elements as well, for convenience.
Endpoints that return an offset will support the stringIndexType  parameter. This parameter
adjusts the offset  and length  attributes in the API output to match the requested string
iteration scheme. Currently, we support three types:
Offsets in the API response
Extracting substrings from text with offsets
\ntextElement_v8  (default): iterates over graphemes as defined by the Unicode 8.0.0
standard
unicodeCodePoint : iterates over Unicode Code Points
, the default scheme for Python 3
utf16CodeUnit : iterates over UTF-16 Code Units
, the default scheme for JavaScript, Java,
and .NET
If the stringIndexType  requested matches the programming environment of choice, substring
extraction can be done using standard substring or slice methods.
