2. If you want to add knowledge bases in multiple languages to your language resource,
visit Language Studio
 to create your first custom question answering project and select
the first option as shown below. Language settings for the language resource can be
specified only when creating a project. If you want to migrate existing knowledge bases in
a single language to the language resource, you can skip this step.
3. Visit https://www.qnamaker.ai
 and select Start Migration in the migration note on the
knowledge base page. A dialog box will open to initiate the migration.
4. Fill in the details required to initiate migration. The tenant will be auto-selected. You can
choose to switch the tenant.

\n6. Select the language resource to which you want to migrate the knowledge bases. You'll
only be able to see those language resources that have custom question answering
enabled. The language setting for the language resource is displayed in the options. You
won’t be able to migrate knowledge bases in multiple languages from QnA Maker
resources to a language resource if its language setting isn't specified.
If you want to migrate knowledge bases in multiple languages to the language resource,
you must enable the multiple language setting when creating the first custom question
answering project for the language resource. You can do so by following the instructions
in step #2. If the language setting for the language resource isn't specified, it is
assigned the language of the selected QnA Maker resource.
7. Select all the knowledge bases that you wish to migrate > select Next.

\n8. You can review the knowledge bases you plan to migrate. There could be some validation
errors in project names as we follow stricter validation rules for custom question
answering projects. To resolve these errors occurring due to invalid characters, select the
checkbox (in red) and select Next. This is a one-click method to replace the problematic
characters in the name with the accepted characters. If there's a duplicate, a new unique
project name is generated by the system.
Ｕ Caution
If you migrate a knowledge base with the same name as a project that already exists
in the target language resource, the content of the project will be overridden by the
content of the selected knowledge base.

\n9. After resolving the validation errors, select Start migration

\n10. It will take a few minutes for the migration to occur. Don't cancel the migration while it is
in progress. You can navigate to the migrated projects within the Language Studio
 post
migration.
If any knowledge bases fail to migrate to custom question answering projects, an error
will be displayed. The most common migration errors occur when:
Your source and target resources are invalid.
You're trying to migrate an empty knowledge base (KB).
You've reached the limit for an Azure Search instance linked to your target
resources.

\nOnce you resolve these errors, you can rerun the migration.
11. The migration will only copy the test instances of your knowledge bases. Once your
migration is complete, you need to manually deploy the knowledge bases to copy the
test index to the production index.
