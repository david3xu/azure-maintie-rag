\nEntity Metadata
06/21/2025
The Entity Metadata object captures optional additional information about detected entities,
providing resolutions specifically for numeric and temporal entities. This attribute is populated
only when there's supplementary data available, enhancing the comprehensiveness of the
detected entities. The Metadata component encompasses resolutions designed for both
numeric and temporal entities. It's important to handle cases where the Metadata attribute
may be empty or absent, as its presence isn't guaranteed for every entity.
Currently, metadata components handle resolutions to a standard format for an entity. Entities
can be expressed in various forms and resolutions provide standard predictable formats for
common quantifiable types. For example, "eighty" and "80" should both resolve to the integer
80 .
You can use NER resolutions to implement actions or retrieve further information. For example,
your service can extract datetime entities to extract dates and times that are provided to a
meeting scheduling system.
This article documents the resolution objects returned for each entity category or subcategory
under the metadata object.
Examples: "10 years old", "23 months old", "sixty Y.O."
JSON
ï¼— Note
Entity Metadata are only supported starting from api-version=2023-04-15-preview. For
older API versions, you may check the Entity Resolutions article.
Numeric Entities
Age
"metadata": {
                "metadataKind": "AgeMetadata",
                "unit": "Year",
                "value": 10
            }
\nPossible values for "unit":
Year
Month
Week
Day
Examples: "30 Egyptian pounds", "77 USD"
JSON
Possible values for "unit" and "ISO4217":
ISO 4217 reference
.
Datetime includes several different subtypes that return different response objects.
Specific days.
Examples: "January 1 1995", "12 april", "7th of October 2022", "tomorrow"
JSON
Currency
"metadata": {
                "unit": "Egyptian pound",
                "ISO4217": "EGP",
                "value": 30
            }
Datetime/Temporal entities
Date
"metadata": {
                "dateValues": [
                    {
                        "timex": "1995-01-01",
                        "value": "1995-01-01"
                    }
                ]
            }
\nWhenever an ambiguous date is provided, you're offered different options for your resolution.
For example, "12 April" could refer to any year. Resolution provides this year and the next as
options. The timex  value XXXX  indicates no year was specified in the query.
JSON
Ambiguity can occur even for a given day of the week. For example, saying "Monday" could
refer to last Monday or this Monday. Once again the timex  value indicates no year or month
was specified, and uses a day of the week identifier (W) to indicate the first day of the week.
JSON
Specific times.
Examples: "9:39:33 AM", "seven AM", "20:03"
JSON
"metadata": {
                "dateValues": [
                    {
                        "timex": "XXXX-04-12",
                        "value": "2022-04-12"
                    },
                    {
                        "timex": "XXXX-04-12",
                        "value": "2023-04-12"
                    }
                ]
            }
"metadata" :{
                "dateValues": [
                    {
                        "timex": "XXXX-WXX-1",
                        "value": "2022-10-03"
                    },
                    {
                        "timex": "XXXX-WXX-1",
                        "value": "2022-10-10"
                    }
                ]
            }
Time
"metadata": {
                "timex": "T09:39:33",
\nSpecific date and time combinations.
Examples: "6 PM tomorrow", "8 PM on January 3rd", "Nov 1 19:30"
JSON
Similar to dates, you can have ambiguous datetime entities. For example, "May 3rd noon"
could refer to any year. Resolution provides this year and the next as options. The timex  value
XXXX indicates no year was specified.
JSON
A datetime range is a period with a beginning and end date, time, or datetime.
Examples: "from january 3rd 6 AM to april 25th 8 PM 2022", "between Monday to Thursday",
"June", "the weekend"
The "duration" parameter indicates the time passed in seconds (S), minutes (M), hours (H), or
days (D). This parameter is only returned when an explicit start and end datetime are in the
query. "Next week" would only return with "begin" and "end" parameters for the week.
                "value": "09:39:33"
            }
Datetime
"metadata": {
                "timex": "2022-10-07T18",
                "value": "2022-10-07 18:00:00"
            }
"metadata": {
                 "dateValues": [ 
                       {
                           "timex": "XXXX-05-03T12",
                           "value": "2022-05-03 12:00:00"
                       },
                       {
                           "timex": "XXXX-05-03T12",
                           "value": "2023-05-03 12:00:00"
                       }
                  ]
              }
Datetime ranges
\nJSON
A set is a recurring datetime period. Sets don't resolve to exact values, as they don't indicate an
exact datetime.
Examples: "every Monday at 6 PM", "every Thursday", "every weekend"
For "every Monday at 6 PM", the timex  value indicates no specified year with the starting
XXXX, then every Monday through WXX-1 to determine first day of every week, and finally T18
to indicate 6 PM.
JSON
Examples: "24 km/hr", "44 square meters", "sixty six kilobytes"
JSON
Possible values for the "unit" field values:
