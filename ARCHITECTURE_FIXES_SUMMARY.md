## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Eliminated Hardcoded Values**

**Before:**
```python
# VIOLATION: Hardcoded patterns and fallbacks
if "search" in query.lower():
    return ["tri_modal_search"]
confidence_threshold = 0.7  # Hardcoded threshold
model_name = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Hardcoded model
```

**After:**
```python
# SOLUTION: Data-driven from Azure services
pattern_analysis = await azure_ml_client.discover_patterns(query)
confidence_threshold = await stats_capability.calculate_optimal_threshold(domain_data)
model_metadata = await azure_ml_client.discover_available_models()
```

### **Established Agent Boundaries**

**Before:**
```python
# VIOLATION: Agent doing extraction directly
class DomainAgent:
    def analyze_content(self, text):
        entities = self.extract_entities(text)  # Should delegate
        return entities
```

**After:**
```python
# SOLUTION: Clear delegation boundaries
class DomainIntelligenceAgent:
    async def analyze_domain_patterns(self, request):
        # Delegates to Azure ML - NEVER processes text directly
        return await azure_ml_client.analyze_patterns(request.content_sources)
```

### **Tool Delegation Architecture**

**Before:**
```python
# VIOLATION: Self-contained processing
def process_document(self, doc):
    text = doc.read()  # Direct file access
    tokens = text.split()  # Direct text processing
    return tokens
```

**After:**
```python
# SOLUTION: Tool delegation
async def process_document(self, doc_id):
    text_tool = await self.tool_manager.get_tool("text_processing")
    return await text_tool.process_document(doc_id, azure_services)
```

### **Azure Service Integration**

**Before:**
```python
# VIOLATION: Mock or hardcoded services
search_results = ["mock_result_1", "mock_result_2"]
```

**After:**
```python
# SOLUTION: Real Azure service integration
search_client = azure_services.search_client
search_results = await search_client.vector_search(
    index_name=config.azure_search_index,
    query_vector=embedding,
    filters=optimization_params
)
```
